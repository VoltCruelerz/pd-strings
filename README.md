# Point Defense Strings

## Changes

- Point defense autocannons now fire in shorter, denser bursts to look more like real-life point defense weaponry and avoid the silliness of seeming to shoot down dead missiles.
- Point defense weapons have also been disambiguated in the UI based on whether or not they can attack things larger than a strikecraft.
  - `PD-A` (Point Defense - Attack): these turrets can be used offensively to attack other ships, such as on the _Garda_.
  - `PD-D` (Point Defense - Defense): these turrets _cannot_ be used offensively, such as those on the _Sova_.
